Probability and statistics:

Homeworks and coding exercises from CENG 222 (IZTECH).

- HW1: Write a small code in Python to visualize the relation between p and variance for Berounlli distribution. Plot a p-variance graph and comment on the result (just with a couple of comment lines in the code).

- HW2: Implementation for Binomial distribution by simulating Bernoulli trials is already given in the course materials. Generate the same distribution by using sub-intervals approach that is proposed for any arbitrary discrete distribution. Plot the histogram of 1000 generated samples.

Probability and statistics:

Homeworks and coding exercises from CENG 222 (IZTECH).

- HW1: Write a small code in Python to visualize the relation between p and variance for Bernoulli distribution. Plot a p-variance graph and comment on the result (just with a couple of comment lines in the code).

- HW2: Implementation for Binomial distribution by simulating Bernoulli trials is already given in the course materials. Generate the same distribution by using sub-intervals approach that is proposed for any arbitrary discrete distribution. Plot the histogram of 1000 generated samples.

- HW3: Investigate the Monty Hall problem. Implement the simulation of the game with two possible strategies (change the selected door / keep the selected door) and calculate the probability of winning for both strategies using the simulation.
 
- HW4: {Monte Carlo Simulations - Continuous} In this assignment you are expected to implement the rejection method for Y and the inverse transformation method for X.
  -  For Y, plot the pdf of the distribution. 
  -  For X, plot the cdf of the distribution. 
  -  For both Y and X, plot the histogram and the cumulative sum of histogram values of the generated samples.

- Image files that describes hw5, hw6, hw7 and hw8 added.
